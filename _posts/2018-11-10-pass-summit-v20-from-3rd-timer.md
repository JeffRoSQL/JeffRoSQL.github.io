# All that I can say is... *"WOW"*

This week I had the opportunity to attend the annual [PASS Summit](https://www.pass.org/summit) in Seattle, WA -  a gathering of professionals who all rally behind the technologies that encompass and support Microsoft SQL Server and its place in the world of data management.  

This year PASS was celebrating it's 20th Summit. So, I began to secure my attendee badge back in the Spring. As months passed, and event day drew closer, I made plans to focus on sessions relating to [SQL Security](http://www.pass.org/summit/2018/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=80308) and strengthening my skills with [Proficient PowerShell](http://www.pass.org/summit/2018/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=80306).

However, it wasn't until I attended the Key Note on Day 1 that I discovered what really moved me. As a giddy Grant Fritchey [(t)](https://twitter.com/GFritchey) paced the stage and introduced Rohan Kumar [(t)](https://twitter.com/RohanKData) to lead the Key Note, the room was a buzz, and I could feel the excitement building. Until then... Cloud technologies screamed my name! _Containers, and Pods and Resource Groups, oh my!_

Needless to say, I was moved. I shifted my focus. Made some adjustments to my session list. And the rock solid agenda kept me so engaged that during downtime at the hotel I was spinning up Kubernetes environments and docker containers in Azure. All the while daydreaming about how I can leverage this newly learned stuff at home. I can't wait to get back to the shop and change the world!  
Sure, there are other technology organizations. And, yes, many of them put together large venue events of training and networking. However, anyone who as been exposed to the PASS organization, and its events, will attest to the fact that it is the "community" that sets itself apart from others. The passion, determination and camaraderie that the members exhibit are tangible things that always draw you in. And _PASS Summit v.20_ did not disappoint.  

Looking forward to PASS Summit v.NEXT!
