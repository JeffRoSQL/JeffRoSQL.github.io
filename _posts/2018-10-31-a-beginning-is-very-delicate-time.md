# Where Do I Begin?

<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  For some time, I have had a desire to write. Perhaps a blog. Maybe some posts on a technical forum. Or just a few notes jotted down on a beer napkin. In any case, I have long felt as if a ton of stuff is bubbling around inside my head, and it just needs to come out.</span>  
[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KYtZIHIgmMM/W9mtqcK6p3I/AAAAAAAAqE4/JWEuEJFolgwNj_DZAN_8jiH4jwo-wFnQACLcBGAs/s200/confused%2Bstormtrooper.jpeg)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KYtZIHIgmMM/W9mtqcK6p3I/AAAAAAAAqE4/JWEuEJFolgwNj_DZAN_8jiH4jwo-wFnQACLcBGAs/s1600/confused%2Bstormtrooper.jpeg)<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  However, also for quite a while, I have struggled with a common feeling that "no one wants to hear what I have to say." Now, this feeling isn't really from a lack of confidence or inadequacy. I am proud of the things that I have experienced. But, I also know many brilliant folks who know a lot of brilliant stuff. So, I argue with myself that the things I want to share are no more important than what others do.</span>  
<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  As a result, nothing ever makes it to paper (or keyboard).  But that's not really the point, is it? I am not trying to "one-up" anyone. And this is not a ploy for fame or notoriety. The purpose of my writing is to get rid of the jumbled mess in my head. Organize it. Set it aside. Move along. So that I can then fit more junk in there.</span>  

## <span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Now what? </span>

<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  Ah... Much better. With that out of the way let's get to what you can expect from me. </span> <span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">While I may occasionally drop a nugget or two of _"JeffRo Personal Life Trivia"_, I</span> do not intend to use this forum to share personal information. If you care enough, and want to get to know me, there are other places and methods more suited for that; social media for example.</span>  
<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  The initial plan for this arena is to follow me around during my professional life. I have been an "IT Guy" for over two decades. As is the nature of the world of Information Technology, there is always an overwhelming amount of things to experience and learn. I am constantly learning new things and overcoming different obstacles. And my brain is running out of room. Hence, my need for this outlet. Hopefully some of the things I will share will be helpful to others in similar situations.</span>  

## <span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">Who is this JeffRo guy?</span>

<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  Who am I? My name is Jeff Rouse. My colleagues and associates call me JeffRo. And </span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">I consider myself to be a seasoned IT Technologist. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  What does that mean?  Well, for </span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">over 20 years I have worked with computer systems, networking infrastructure and the processes that can make IT successful. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">I've been a [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) junkie since Window for Workgroups, and present myself as an expert in most all Microsoft technologies. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"></span>[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uSeV7YX3mpA/W9muSjbjuMI/AAAAAAAAqFA/SDHB5rK_aGwUMXSFd5d4q-ln7qDrL05UQCLcBGAs/s200/DeathStar2.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uSeV7YX3mpA/W9muSjbjuMI/AAAAAAAAqFA/SDHB5rK_aGwUMXSFd5d4q-ln7qDrL05UQCLcBGAs/s1600/DeathStar2.jpg)<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"></span>  

<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">I have managed networking infrastructure issues from Ethernet to Token Ring (bleh), and am intimate with almost all technologies and protocols that support network "plumbing" ([APSTNDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)).</span></div>

<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">My more recent projects have allowed me to build a solid skill-set in Database Architecture and Administration; leveraging platforms such</span> [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">,</span> [Netezza](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/netezza)<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">, and</span> [DB2-LUW](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_10.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.kc.doc/welcome.html)<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;"></span>  

<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">In addition, my professional experience has allowed me to work in a wide variety of markets - finance, telecommunications, medical practice management, audio/visual, health insurance, law enforcement and more.</span></div>

## <span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">So what? </span>

<div style="text-align: right;">

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">  The future of IT is always in motion (thanks [Master Yoda](https://youtu.be/nt7-WKXL5vw)). Even a brand new recruit can bring fresh ideas and information to the team and teach an old guy like me new tricks. While I'm not new to my industry, I am an infant in the arena of writing. So, as mentioned above, I hope that I can share a small nugget of experience or knowledge that may one day help someone on their path to the Dark Side...</span></div>

</div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">... If not, at least I cleared out the clutter. </span></div>
